# LG-Case-Filer
A proof of concept application to simply the format and process of LG77 and LG99 case questions

As-Is this is a front end only application, it has not been deployed. The idea could be scaled to cover a few functions or sets of data agents dont currently have access to. The theme/format of the application is currently in the style of a game. (can be changed)

Full cuntionality could include things like what agencies are email-only, LG case logic to reduce some call times. (not having to manually type out questions, just fill out the questions, hit copy, and paste the answers into notes. (this would also make sure all LG questions are formatted the same, and would be manually updated when we have any changes to LG questions)

There is currently no database/api so nothing used on the application is saved, and since i have no certifications to protect that data, would prefer it remain that way. On closing the application any typed text should be lost.
