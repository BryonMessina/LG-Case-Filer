# LG-Case-Filer
LG-Case-Filer is a lightweight, front-end–only proof-of-concept application designed to streamline and standardize LG77 and LG99 case questions. It helps reduce manual typing, improve consistency, and simplify the overall workflow for agents.

Purpose
-Provide a quick, structured way to fill out LG case questions
-Auto-format responses for easy copy-and-paste into notes
-Ensure all LG questions follow a consistent, up-to-date format
-Demonstrate how case logic tools could reduce call and handling time

Current Status
-Front-end only
-No backend, database, or API
-No data is stored — all inputs are cleared when the app is closed or refreshed
-The UI uses a game-style theme (can be changed)

Future Possibilities
-Reference pages for information KA's do not provide such as: email-only agencies
-More LG logic tools to assist with case workflows
-Expansion to additional question sets or internal processes

Data & Privacy
-Because no data is saved or transmitted, nothing is shared over the wire.

Usage
-Currently requires a download to run the .html or to be loaded on a live server through something like VS code.
-If this were to be allowed as an approved resource i can deploy it through a service such as Ionos, or a different service if one is preferred at my own expense.
